Avoid Falling Blocks — Game Mechanics

Objective
Stay alive as long as you can by avoiding falling blocks. You control a square that can move left or right and shrink to dodge blocks.

How to Play
Blocks fall from the top. If one hits your square, the game ends.
Let blocks fall past the bottom to earn points — each block that passes gives you 1 point.
Shrink your square to dodge blocks, but shrinking costs points, so use it wisely.

Controls
j: Toggle moving left (press once to start, press again to stop).
l: Toggle moving right (press once to start, press again to stop).
Pressing the opposite direction will switch your movement immediately.
a: If you hold it is Shrinks your square while pressed. Pressing a subtracts 3 points (minimum 0). Release to stop shrinking.
Continuous movement for more than 1 second slows your square to half speed.

Scoring
Score goes up by 1 for every block that falls past the bottom.
Shrinking costs 3 points on the first press — careful!
After 10 points, falling blocks start rotating.

Block Behavior
Blocks fall at a set speed, which can increase or change over time.
When a block falls past the bottom, it resets to a random horizontal position at the top.

Game Over
The game ends if a block hits your square. The background will change to show the game is over.
Shrinking below the minimum size also ends the game.

Tips
Toggle movement instead of holding keys to avoid overshooting.
Use short shrinks to dodge blocks without losing too many points.
Try to let blocks fall past the bottom to increase your score until the rotation mechanic kicks in.

Notes
You can tweak controls or scoring in Template/script.js.
If anything seems off, check the browser console — it logs score and collisions for debugging.
